### Exercises, Week 2

0. Please complete exercises from [Widgets](lessons/07_OtherCommonWidgets.md) and [ContentProviders](lessons/08_ContentProviders.md) if you haven't done so.

1. Choose an issue from the Github Android App. Pair program and work on it with a partner. Whomever feels weaker at the material should drive.  

2. Open issues on your classmates’ Unit 2 final projects.  

3. Create a feed of cards (similar to your Unit 2 final projects) where each card is a fragment.  

4. Turn the feed from (3) into a library that’s easy for other developers to use and document it. Ask your fellow devs for code review (and kindly code review them back).
