#### Review  
This section is required for those who failed the Unit 2 Assessment.  
Choose a dataset from Dava.gov and create an app visualizing some piece of data available.  

#### Requirements:  
You must use a JSON dataset.  
You must fetch the data in realtime - i.e. do not download the data beforehand. However, downloading the data beforehand may be a good idea while you’re developing/testing.  
This does not have to look pretty or do anything particularly interesting. The point is to practice making a network connection and fetching and parsing data.  

#### Homework
### Part I
Choose a Meme-ify Me App that you haven’t yet worked with.  
If the feature exists that provides default meme templates (e.g. Scumbag Steve etc.) refactor it so that the default meme images are stored in a database.  If the feature does not exist then add such a feature (using a database!).  
Create a pull request to the Meme App, and submit the link to this PR.  

### Part II  
Look at the Wordpress for Android open source project.  
Choose three open issues and identify the files that you think you would need to read or change in order to close those issues. Include if you would need to add files and how those would fit in.  

#### Bonus
Close any of those issues from Part II and submit your changes as PRs to the Access Code fork.  

#### Submission
Submit the links to your PRs to Veena via this [form] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t73hVVucTggC0ZAfAl03LIpc5cDACBUtt1A7Qu-6JCA/viewform?usp=send_form).
