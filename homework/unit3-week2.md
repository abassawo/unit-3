### Homework -- week 2 (unit 3)

#### Review  
#### This section is required for those who failed the Unit 2 Assessment.  
Start with the app you worked on for last week’s review section.  

Add a feature that provides the user with a notification. If you don’t have ideas about what warrants a notification, just make the notification pop up at the same time every day.  

If you’re not currently displaying data using an adapter, add a feature where you display data using an adapter.  

Change the threading model that you’d used last week to a new one (for example, if you’d used AsyncTask then you should use Runnable or Retrofit, and if you’d used Retrofit you should use something else).  


#### Homework  

Working with your Unit 2 final project, create a tablet layout using fragments. In the tablet layout, the feed should be a fragment, and when a card is clicked, the detail view should be displayed in another fragment.  


#### Bonus  

Open issues on your classmates’ Unit 2 final projects. Work on the issues others leave on your project. Feel free to solicit your classmates to give you issues to work on.
