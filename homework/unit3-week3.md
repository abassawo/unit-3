### Homework -- Week 3  

In preparation for the hackathon this weekend, please familiarize yourself with the [Aunt Bertha API](https://www.auntbertha.com/developers).  
You will have to create an Aunt Bertha account first and log in before viewing the documentation.  

You might find it useful to review some of these concepts from the past units:  
* [Async Task and REST](../lessons/08_Async-REST.md)  
* [JSON](../lessons/week-4/2015-04-04_json.md)  
* [Sensors](../lessons/11_Sensors.md)  
* Your [Google Now Apps](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-2/blob/master/project/requirements.md)!  
* [Last week's exercises](exercises/week2.md) to solidify concepts from last week

Be prepared to hit the ground running this weekend...Have fun! :-)  

n.b. You don't have to submit anything for this assignment.
