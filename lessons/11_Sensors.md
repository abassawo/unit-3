### Sensors

#### Do Now  
Make an app that has two buttons: one that looks like a camera button and the other an audio recording button.

#### Morning Lesson
* Camera
* Location  

#### Morning Exercises  
Implement the camera button to take a picture. When the picture is taken, add it to a gallery of images on your app with the geolocated address of the current location printed out in an adjacent TextView.

#### Afternoon Lesson  
* Audio  
* Accelerometer  
* Touch  

#### Afternoon Exercises
Implement the audio recording button. When the audio is recorded, also add it to the gallery with the geolocated address printed in an adjacent TextView.

Then, use the accelerometer so that tilting the device can scroll through the gallery.
