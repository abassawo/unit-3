## Material Design  
Yang Mou  

#### Material Design
Visual language developed by Google and used throughout Google's websites. Metaphor of using materials, especially paper and ink, as visual cues. It uses bold colors, large text, and ample space. There's also strong emphasis on motion to help provide meaning.

On web, Material Design replaces Kennedy (compare [Inbox](https://inbox.google.com) to vanilla [Gmail](https://mail.google.com))

On Android, Material Design is the default for Android 5.0 (Lollipop), replacing Holo on Android 4.x

#### Android support libraries
The easiest way to get the most from Material Design is to use the Android support libraries. This will ensure that your apps work on basically every version of Android out there.

In your app.gradle: `compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.1'`

All your activities should extend `AppCompatActivity`

Your themes should have parent `Theme.AppCompat` or `Theme.AppCompat.Light`
