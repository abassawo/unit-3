## Other Third-Party APIs

#### Objective

Students will understand how third-party libraries can aid them in performing tasks in an efficient manner, for web API requests and beyond.

#### Lesson (Morning)

##### Picasso

Picasso is a library for downloading, transforming, and displaying images from the web or a local resource.

> Demo

> Create an app that pulls an image from the web and displays it, then show how it can be improved with Picasso

##### ButterKnife

ButterKnife is a view injection library that dramatically simplifies the way UI elements are referenced and bound to from Activities and more.

> Demo

> Update the app to include ButterKnife to do some view binding, image resizing, as well as adding a button to play a sound when clicked

##### RetroFit + GSON

RetroFit is a library that takes the monotony and pain out of building and processing web requests. When coupled with GSON to parse JSON into native objects, they create a simple way to get information from the web into the form Android expects.

> Demo

> Create a skeleton for an app that lists GitHub repos for a given user

##### Parceler

Parceler allows the objects parsed by GSON to be easily passed in intents between classes in an efficient manner.

##### Dependency Injection and Dagger

Dagger is a Dependency Injection library that aids in the decoupling of complex data structures. We'll introduce the concept of Dependency Injection, and give a brief intro into Dagger and it's alternatives.

##### More Tools

We'll also cover a few other tools that can aid in general.

#### Bonus Do Now (Late Morning / Afternoon)

> Create an app using RetroFit that populates a listview with your repositories on github.
